# Zen Hexagon Tiles | WebGL Shader

Welcome to the **Zen Hexagon Tiles** project, a stunning WebGL shader demonstration that showcases interactive, animated hexagonal tiles. This project uses **Babel JS** for modern JavaScript features and **LESS CSS** for efficient and organized styling. The power of **WebGL** and **GLSL shaders** creates a smooth and dynamic visual experience, making it perfect for backgrounds, interactive web designs, or as an artistic showcase.

## Live Demo

## Features

- **Hexagonal Tile Grid**: A smooth and responsive grid of hexagonal tiles rendered with WebGL shaders.
- **Interactive Shader Effects**: Shaders dynamically respond to user input (e.g., mouse movement, scroll) for a more immersive experience.
- **Zen Aesthetic**: The color palette and smooth animations create a relaxing, zen-like visual environment.
- **WebGL Shaders**: Custom GLSL shaders are used for creating effects like lighting, color gradients, and movement.
- **Babel JS**: Utilized to enable modern JavaScript syntax (ES6+) and features across different environments.
- **LESS CSS**: CSS is organized and optimized using LESS, making styling easier to manage and extend.

## Technologies Used

- **WebGL**: For rendering interactive 2D and 3D graphics in the browser without plugins.
- **GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language)**: Used for writing custom shaders to render the visual effects.
- **Babel JS**: Transpiles modern JavaScript (ES6+) into backward-compatible code for broader browser support.
- **LESS CSS**: A preprocessor to extend CSS with variables, nested rules, and functions, simplifying complex styles.
- **HTML5 Canvas**: For drawing and rendering the WebGL content.

## Getting Started

To view or clone this project, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Vercel demo link](https://infinityzen.vercel.app/) to see the project in action.
2. If you'd like to customize or experiment with the project:
   - Clone the project to your own CodePen account.
   - Modify the WebGL shader code or JavaScript logic to suit your needs.
3. Optionally, you can download the project files and set it up locally for further exploration.

### Prerequisites

To run the Zen Hexagon Tiles project locally, you'll need:

- A modern web browser with WebGL support (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
- A local server if you prefer testing on your machine (use Python, Node.js, or any local server setup).
- **Node.js** and **npm** for installing project dependencies (if setting up locally).

### Installing Dependencies Locally

If you're setting up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/LAKSHIBRO/infinityzen
   cd infinityzen
